ABOUT
========
But what is it, you might ask?

It's easy: you draw tiny little pictures, then use them anywhere you want. You
only get 121 pixels and two colors, but hey, that didn't stop anyone in the
80's.


INSTALLING
========
This is inteded to be run in the Google App Engine.

For instructions on how to get starting with that, see:
See http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/gettingstarted
